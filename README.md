# Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of **Assignment 2** for the Machine Learning course at **Cairo University, Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence**. The project aims to predict weather conditions (rain or no rain) using machine learning models, including Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Naïve Bayes.  

The deliverable is a single Python script containing all tasks, from preprocessing the dataset to implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluating their performance.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Handle missing data with two techniques (dropping and replacing with mean).
  - Apply feature scaling and split the data into training and testing sets.
- **Machine Learning Models**
  - Implementation of Decision Tree, kNN, and Naïve Bayes using scikit-learn.
  - Custom implementation of kNN from scratch.
- **Performance Evaluation**
  - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall.
  - Comparison of custom kNN and scikit-learn kNN.
- **Visualization**
  - Decision Tree visualization with explanations.
